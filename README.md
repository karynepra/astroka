# AstroPy Tools — From Basics to Advanced

This repository is part of my PhD journey in Astronomy, where I organize Python tools for reading and analyzing astronomical data. The goal is to build a personal toolkit — from basic tasks like reading FITS headers to more advanced spectral analysis.

## 📁 Current Modules

### `headers/`
Tools to:
- Scan directories for `.fits` files
- Extract FITS headers
- Select and structure specific header keywords

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- astropy
- pathlib

Install with:

```bash
pip install astropy
